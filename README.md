# MVP
Here is example of MVP architecture including:
-Coordinator pattern
-DI (Dependency injection and also Dependency inversion using protocols)
-SOLID principles
-Networking
-Builder pattern

Disclimer:
Networking layer might not working due to test server restrictions but Im trying to show how exactly MVP works with SOLID principles.
